For my portfolio project, I plan to develop a board game. It is sort of a chess variant, but there are key differences from the rules of traditional chess. In this board game, called King’s Watchmen, there is a 9x9 board. There are two types of pieces the king and the queen. The piece's moves are determined by rolling a six-sided dice. The goal of the game is to capture the opponent’s king.  
I will try to code the rules of the game, the piece movement, and the 9x9 board in C++. There will be a piece class, and both the king and queen classes will inherit the piece class. I will try to use a random number generator to roll the six-sided dice. After coding the logic the next step is to implement a graphical user interface. For the GUI I plan to use wxWidgets which is a GUI library for C++.
